# Python Mini-Games Collection

This repository features three engaging Python terminal games developed for learning, fun, and skill-building. Each game is built with a focus on logic, user interaction, and replayability.

### 1. Russian Roulette
A suspenseful command-line game simulating the classic game of chance. Players spin a virtual revolver and test their luck, never knowing when the bullet will fire. The game's random mechanics and tense atmosphere make every round unpredictable and exciting.

### 2. Snake Water Gun
A Python adaptation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors," but with a twist: Snake, Water, and Gun. Users play against the computer, choosing their move each round while the computer picks randomly. The game logic determines who wins each round based on unique rules, offering fast-paced, replayable action.

### 3. The Perfect Guess
An interactive guessing game where the computer selects a random number, and the player tries to guess it in as few attempts as possible. After each guess, the player receives feedback (“too high” or “too low”) to help zero in on the secret number. Tracks the number of attempts, encouraging improvement and competition.

**All games** are fully interactive, beginner-friendly, and run directly in the terminal. Perfect for practicing Python basics, control flow, and user input handling.
